    <li>09/2015 ~ Unknown <strong>Junior in Information and Computation Science</strong>,<br>                    School of Mathematics and Information Science, Shaanxi Normal University, China.</li>
    <br>
    <li>09/2017 ~ 01/2018 <strong>Exchange Student in Department of Mathematics</strong>,<br>                    College of Science, National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan.</li>
    During the exchange period, I studied “Numerical analysis” ,”Information Theory and Coding Technique”
    and “Discrete Mathematics” with grades B, A- and A. Although I learned most aknowledge of Discrete Math,
    I still pick up the idea of "Generating Functions".

    <li>Dec. 2016 : Second Prize of National Cryptography Math Challenge( held in 2016).</li>
        The 1-st contest contain 3 main problems and I chose the third problem -- Attacks On Weak RSA System. The question
    gave us 21 cipher texts who were encripted by 21 different pairs of (e,N). The massages are padded to 512 bits and Ns
    are up to 1024 bits.
        The first time I saw the question I thought it is impossible to factor all the big integer N. However, it is a
    CONTEST such that there must be some weak prime factors or some other tricks. So with some tips mentioned in reference,
    I did some trivial check like whether there are some pair of N share one same prime? In this approach, I found there
    were actually two N share same prime and two N are same! So Common Modulus Attack came into force.
        Then I tried all the attacks to RSA(CRT attack, Copper-Smith Attack, p-1 algorithm, Rho algorithm), some works,
    some didn't work. But as the first time to join a contest, I felt it amazing to gain second prize.
        On the beginning of the challenge to this problem, I can only programming with C, and can't load GMP library on
    my Macbook. So I search for java's BigInteger class to deal with all the arithmetic between big integers( such like
    gcd(N1,N2), Chinese Reminder Theorem etc). Macbook is a powerful productivity tools to compile java program in terminal.


    <li>Jan. 2018 : First Prize of National Cryptography Math Challenge( held in 2017).</li>
        The 2-ed contest contain 4 main problems and I chose the problem two -- 「Math Problems in Correlation Attacks」.
    The question is to calculate the initial value(or called <i>seed</i>) of a LFSR. The question just gave us a binary
    sequence gained by transferring through a BSC(Binary symmetric channel) with crossover probability p. When you get some
    initial values, the lower p is, the higher scores you get.
        Facing this problem, I have no experience at all. But after one year to practice, I find python is elegant
    programming language since it can be vary short and easy to debug. Preparing the programming language and its IDE(Spyder).
    I began to read all the papers the question mentioned.
        Although I found it finally need a faster language such like C++, python did a lot of work on the sketch of the
    algorithm. After reading all 4 papers, I found the last algorithm mentioned in the last paper-"Improved fast correlation
    attack using low rate codes." is most powerful. It is improved correlation at- tack based on maximum likelihood
    decoding. Using this algorithm, the 9/12 of the data are encrypted.

    <li>Dec. 2016 : Bronze Medal of The ACM-ICPC Asia Regional Contest <strong>China-Final 2016 </strong>held in Shanghai University</li>
        ACM is a team work contest. Every time we three members obtain a algorithm of a problem, I can coding it with C++
    quickly. Although there are almost 2 years not dealing with ACM problems, the skills I learned is engraved in my brain.
    Such like binary search idea, are used in both two National Cryptography Math Challenge.
