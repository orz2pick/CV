    <li>09/2015 ~ Unknown <strong>Junior in Information and Computation Science</strong>,<br>                    School of Mathematics and Information Science, Shaanxi Normal University, China.</li>
    <li>09/2017 ~ 01/2018 <strong>Exchange Student in Department of Mathematics</strong>,<br>                    College of Science, National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan.</li>
    During the exchange period, I studied “Numerical analysis” ,”Information Theory and Coding Technique”
    and “Discrete Mathematics” with grades B, A- and A grades. Although I have learned most knowledges of Discrete Math,
    I still pick up the idea of "Generating Functions".

    <li>Dec. 2016 : Second Prize of National Cryptography Math Challenge( held in 2016).</li>
        The 1-st contest contained 3 main problems and I chose the third problem -- Attacks On Weak RSA System. The system
    gave us 21 cipher texts who were encripted by 21 different pairs of (e,N). The messages are padded to 512 bits and Ns
    were up to 1024 bits.
        The first time I saw the problem I thought it's impossible to factor all the big integer N. However, it is a
    public CONTEST, so there must be some weak prime factors(p-1 or p+1 is a lower B-smooth number) or some other tricks.
    So with some tips mentioned in reference,I did some trivial check like whether there were some pair of N share one
    same prime factor? In this approach, I found there were actually two N share same prime and two N are same! So Common
    Modulus Attack came into force.
        Then I tried all the attacks to RSA(CRT attack, Copper-Smith Attack, p-1 algorithm, Rho algorithm), some worked,
    some didn't. But it's the first time to participate a contest, I felt it amazing to gain the second prize.
        At the beginning of the challenge, I can only program with C, meanwhile I can't load GMP library on
    my Macbook. So I googled for java's BigInteger class to deal with all the arithmetics between big integers( such like
    gcd(N1,N2), Chinese Reminder Theorem etc). After all, Macbook is a powerful productivity tool to compile java program
    in terminal.

    <li>Jan. 2018 : First Prize of National Cryptography Math Challenge( held in 2017).</li>
        The 2-ed contest contained 4 main problems and I chose the problem two -- 「Math Problems in Correlation Attacks」.
    The question was to calculate the initial value(or called <i>seed</i>) of a LFSR. The question just gave me a binary
    sequence obtained by transferring a binary sequence through a BSC(Binary symmetric channel) with crossover probability
    p. When you get the initial values, the lower p is, the higher scores you get.
        Facing this problem, I have no ideas at all. But after one year of the 1-st contest, I find python is an elegant
    programming language since it can be very short and easy to debug. Preparing the programming language and its IDE(Spyder).
    I began to read all the papers the problem mentioned.
        Although I found it finally need a faster language such like C++, python did a lot of work on the sketch of the
    algorithm. After reading all 4 papers, I found the last algorithm mentioned in the last paper-"Improved fast correlation
    attack using low rate codes." was most powerful. It is improved correlation attack based on maximum likelihood
    decoding. Using this algorithm, the 9/12 of the data were encrypted.

    <li>Dec. 2016 : Bronze Medal of The ACM-ICPC Asia Regional Contest <strong>China-Final 2016 </strong>held in Shanghai University</li>
        ACM is a teamwork contest. Every time we three members obtain a algorithm of a problem together, I can code it with C++
    quickly. Although there are almost 2 years not dealing with ACM problems, the skills I learned are engraved in my mind.
    Such like the binary search idea, which are used in both two National Cryptography Math Challenge, is like a common thing in
    my brain.
